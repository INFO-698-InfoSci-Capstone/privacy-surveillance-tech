### Date: 
Week number, today's date, etc. 


### Number of hours: 
A quantity of hours, maybe towards specific tasks. 

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous weekly/bi-weekly working period, such as something you found particularly rewarding. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud: 
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future. 

### Thorn: 
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. 

## Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.

### Date: 
3/28. 


### Number of hours: 
15 hours (over a two-week span): 
- Explore Meta/facebook content moderation and community standards websites. 
- Explore the Wayback Machine.
- Develop Python script for scraping data from the Wayback Machine, run the code, fetch the data, and check it.
- Met mentor 
- Draft Python script to de-duplicate downloaded data

### Rose:
- Kept narrowing down project scope
- Script for scraping data worked (almost) perfect

### Bud: 
- Looking forward to start the content analysis via NLP methods (topic modelling, similarity, etc.). 
- Thining about what methods would be best fr this.

### Thorn: 
- Part of the scraping code did not work. I was not able to follow facebook's pages internal links recursively.
- Wondering whether it is possible or if I would have to do it manually
