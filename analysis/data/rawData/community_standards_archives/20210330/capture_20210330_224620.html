We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is credible, we may also consider additional information like a person's public visibility and the risks to their physical safety. \n  \n     In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non credible absent specific evidence to the contrary.  \n  \n "},dangerous_individuals_organizations:{other_content:"\n   \n  \n    We do not allow the following people (living or deceased) or groups to maintain a presence (for example, have an account, Page, Group) on our platform: \n    \nTerrorist organizations and terrorists, which include:\n   \n \n\t Any non-state actor that:\n  \t \n       Engages in, advocates, or lends substantial support to purposive and planned acts of violence, \n       Which causes or attempts to cause death, injury or serious harm to civilians, or any other person not taking direct part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, and/or significant damage to property linked to death, serious injury or serious harm to civilians \n    \t With the intent to coerce, intimidate and/or influence a civilian population, government, or international organization \n       In order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological aim. \n     \n   \n \n \n     \n \nHate organizations and their leaders and prominent members     \n \n   A hate organization is defined as:\n  \t \n    \t Any association of three or more people that is organized under a name, sign, or symbol and that has an ideology, statements, or physical actions that attack individuals based on characteristics, including race, religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation, serious disease or disability. \n     \n     \n \n \n     \n Mass and multiple murderers (including attempts) \n\t \n     We consider a homicide to be a mass murder if it results in three or more deaths in one incident \n     We consider an attempted mass murder to be one where an individual uses a weapon or vehicle to attempt mass harm in a public space or against more than one person \n     We consider any individual who has committed two or more murders over multiple incidents or locations a multiple murderer \n    \n   \n \n     \n Human trafficking groups and their leaders\n\t \n     Human trafficking groups are organizations responsible for any of the following:\n    \t \n      \t Prostitution of others, forced/bonded labor, slavery, or the removal of organs \n         Recruiting, transporting, transferring, detaining, providing, harboring, or receiving a minor, or an adult against their will \n       \n     \n   \n \n\n Criminal organizations and their leaders and prominent members\n\t \n     A criminal organization is defined as:\n    \t \n      \t Any association of three or more people that is united under a name, color(s), hand gesture(s) or recognized indicia, that has engaged in or threatens to engage in criminal activity, including (but not limited to)\n        \t \n          \t\t Homicide \n               Drug trafficking \n               Arms trafficking \n               Identity theft \n               Money laundering \n               Extortion or trafficking \n               Assault \n               Kidnapping \n             Sexual exploitation (covered in  section 7  and  section 8 ) \n           \n         \n       \n     \n   \n \n     \n      We do not allow symbols that represent any of the above organizations or individuals to be shared on our platform without context that condemns or neutrally discusses the content. \n     \n      We do not allow content that praises any of the above organizations or individuals or any acts committed by them. \n     \n      We do not allow coordination of support for any of the above organizations or individuals or any acts committed by them. \n      We do not allow content that praises, supports, or represents events that Facebook designates as terrorist attacks, hate events, mass murders or attempted mass murders, serial murders, hate crimes and violating events. \n      We do not allow the following groups to maintain a Page, Group, Event or IG profile on our platform, or to have one maintained on their behalf.

We are a service for more than two billion people to freely express themselves across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages. \n     We recognize how important it is for Facebook to be a place where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take seriously our role in keeping abuse off our service. That’s why we’ve  developed a set of Community Standards  that outline what is and is not allowed on Facebook. Our policies are based on feedback from our community and the advice of experts in fields such as technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure that everyone’s voice is valued, we take great care to craft policies that are inclusive of different views and beliefs, in particular those of people and communities that might otherwise be overlooked or marginalized. \n   \n         \n     REITERATING OUR COMMITMENT TO VOICE \n     The goal of our Community Standards has always been to  create a place for expression and give people a voice . This has not and will not change. Building community and bringing the world closer together depends on people’s ability to share diverse views, experiences, ideas and information. We want people to be able to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable. In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Standards – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards,  as reflected in our Corporate Human Rights Policy,   to make these judgments. As such, we consider the newsworthiness of content posted by anyone, including news organizations and individuals users. For example, we have allowed content that graphically depicts war or the consequences of war where it is important to public discourse.  \n    \n     Our commitment to expression is paramount, but we recognize the internet creates new and increased opportunities for abuse. For these reasons, when we limit expression, we do it in service of one or more of the following values: \n   \n       \n\n     Authenticity:  We want to make sure the content people are seeing on Facebook is authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that’s why we don’t want people using Facebook to misrepresent who they are or what they’re doing.\n \n    \n    \n      \n    \n     Safety:  We are committed to making Facebook a safe place. Expression that threatens people has the potential to intimidate, exclude or silence others and isn’t allowed on Facebook. \n  \n    \n  \n    \n    \n     Privacy:  We are committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves, and to choose how and when to share on Facebook and to connect more easily.\n \n        \n  \n    \n     Dignity:  We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others. \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n     Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. They’re designed to be comprehensive – for example, content that might not be considered hateful may still be removed for violating a different policy. We recognize that words mean different things or affect people differently depending on their local community, language, or background. We work hard to account for these nuances while also applying our policies consistently and fairly to people and their expression. Our enforcement of these standards relies on information available to us. In some cases, this means that we may not detect content and behavior that violates these standards, and in others,  enforcement may be limited to circumstances where we have been provided with additional information and context. \n\n     People can report potentially violating content, including Pages, Groups, Profiles, individual content, and comments. We also give people control over their own experience by allowing them to\n       block ,   unfollow \n       or \n        hide  people and posts.\n       \n\n     The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the violation and the person's history on the platform. For instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if they continue to violate our policies, we may restrict their ability to post on Facebook or disable their profile. We also may notify law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. \n     Our Community Standards are a guide for what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook.
