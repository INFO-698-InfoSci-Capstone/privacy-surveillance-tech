The conversations that happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more than one billion people. <br /><br /> We want people to feel safe when using Facebook. For that reason, we&#039;ve developed a set of Community Standards, outlined below. These policies will help you understand what type of sharing is allowed on Facebook, and what type of content may be reported to us and removed. Because of the diversity of our global community, please keep in mind that something that may be disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community Standards. </div></div></div></div></div><div class="_w_k"><div class="_4-u2 _w_j _4-u8" id="keeping_you_safe"><div class="_w_m"><div class="clearfix _2auw"><div class="_4bl7 _2aux _w_p _4bl8"><a href="#cs-header">Back to top<i class="_2auy img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_e48816"></i></a></div><div class="_4bl9">Helping to Keep you Safe</div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="_4bl7 _2auz"><i class="img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_c44607"></i></div><div class="_4bl9"><div id="u_0_0"><span class="img _55ym _55yq _55yo _3kks" aria-label="Loading..." aria-busy="1"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="_w_k"><div class="_4-u2 _w_j _4-u8" id="encouraging_respect"><div class="_w_m"><div class="clearfix _2auw"><div class="_4bl7 _2aux _w_p _4bl8"><a href="#cs-header">Back to top<i class="_2auy img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_e48816"></i></a></div><div class="_4bl9">Encouraging respectful behavior</div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="_4bl7 _2auz"><i class="img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_e03a5e"></i></div><div class="_4bl9"><div id="u_0_2"><span class="img _55ym _55yq _55yo _3kks" aria-label="Loading..." aria-busy="1"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="_w_k"><div class="_4-u2 _w_j _4-u8" id="keeping_account_safe"><div class="_w_m"><div class="clearfix _2auw"><div class="_4bl7 _2aux _w_p _4bl8"><a href="#cs-header">Back to top<i class="_2auy img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_e48816"></i></a></div><div class="_4bl9">Keeping your account and personal information secure</div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="_4bl7 _2auz"><i class="img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_384b17"></i></div><div class="_4bl9"><div id="u_0_3"><span class="img _55ym _55yq _55yo _3kks" aria-label="Loading..." aria-busy="1"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="_w_k"><div class="_4-u2 _w_j _4-u8" id="protect_property"><div class="_w_m"><div class="clearfix _2auw"><div class="_4bl7 _2aux _w_p _4bl8"><a href="#cs-header">Back to top<i class="_2auy img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_e48816"></i></a></div><div class="_4bl9">Protecting your intellectual property</div></div><div class="clearfix"><div class="_4bl7 _2auz"><i class="img sp_k6NDE16Bxdr sx_d6092c"></i></div><div class="_4bl9"><div id="u_0_1"><span class="img _55ym _55yq _55yo _3kks" aria-label="Loading..." aria-busy="1"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="_w_q"><div class="_w_j"><div class="_w_m"><div class="_2auw _3ma">Reporting Abuse</div><div class="clearfix"><div class="_4bl7 _w_p _4bl8"><a class="_42ft _4jy0 _55pi _2agf _w_n _4jy3 _4jy2 selected _51sy" role="button" href="/help/181495968648557?ref=community_standards" style="max-width:160px;"><span class="_55pe" style="max-width:160px;">Reporting Abuse</span></a><a class="_42ft _4jy0 _55pi _2agf _w_n _4jy3 _517h _51sy" role="button" href="/help/212722115425932?ref=community_standards" style="max-width:160px;"><span class="_55pe" style="max-width:160px;">Controlling What You See</span></a><a class="_42ft _4jy0 _55pi _2agf _w_n _4jy3 _517h _51sy" role="button" href="/help/128548343894719?ref=community_standards" style="max-width:160px;"><span class="_55pe" style="max-width:160px;">Communication Tools</span></a></div><div class="_4bl9 _w_r"> Our global community is growing every day and we strive to welcome people to an environment free from abusive content. To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/181495968648557">please report it to us</a>. We have dedicated teams working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. <br /><br /> Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. <br /><br /> Please keep the following in mind: <br /><br /><ul class="_p7q"><li> We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </li><li> We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </li><li> Reporting something doesn&#039;t guarantee that it will be removed because it may not violate our policies. </li><li> Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </li><li> Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook Profile. </li><li> The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </li><li> The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the violation and the person&#039;s history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a person&#039;s ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook.</li></ul><br /> Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding the posts, people, Pages, and applications you donât want to see â and we encourage you to use these controls to better personalize your experience. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/212722115425932">Learn more</a>.

To do this, we rely on people like you. If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/www/181495968648557">please report it to us</a>. We have dedicated teams working around the world to review things you report to help make sure Facebook remains safe. <br /><br /> Governments also sometimes ask us to remove content that violates local laws, but does not violate our Community Standards. If after careful legal review, we find that the content is illegal under local law, then we may make it unavailable only in the relevant country or territory. <br /><br /> Please keep the following in mind: <br /><br /><ul class="_p7q"><li> We may take action any time something violates the Community Standards outlined here. </li><li> We may ask Page owners to associate their name and Facebook Profile with a Page that contains cruel and insensitive content, even if that content does not violate our policies. </li><li> Reporting something doesn&#039;t guarantee that it will be removed because it may not violate our policies. </li><li> Our content reviewers will look to you for information about why a post may violate our policies. If you report content, please tell us why the content should be removed (e.g., is it nudity or hate speech?) so that we can send it to the right person for review. </li><li> Our review decisions may occasionally change after receiving additional context about specific posts or after seeing new, violating content appearing on a Page or Facebook Profile. </li><li> The number of reports does not impact whether something will be removed. We never remove content simply because it has been reported a number of times. </li><li> The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the violation and the person&#039;s history on Facebook. For instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if we continue to see further violations we may restrict a person&#039;s ability to post on Facebook or ban the person from Facebook.</li></ul><br /> Not all disagreeable or disturbing content violates our Community Standards. For this reason, we offer you the ability to customize and control what you see by unfollowing, blocking, and hiding the posts, people, Pages, and applications you donât want to see â and we encourage you to use these controls to better personalize your experience. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/212722115425932">Learn more</a>.

We restrict the display of nudity because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content - particularly because of their cultural background or age. In order to treat people fairly and respond to reports quickly, it is essential that we have policies in place that our global teams can apply uniformly and easily when reviewing content. As a result, our policies can sometimes be more blunt than we would like and restrict content shared for legitimate purposes. We are always working to get better at evaluating this content and enforcing our standards. \u003Cbr \/>\u003Cbr \/> We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks. We also restrict some images of female breasts if they include the nipple, but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breastfeeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring. We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude figures. Restrictions on the display of both nudity and sexual activity also apply to digitally created content unless the content is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical purposes. Explicit images of sexual intercourse are prohibited.
