For public figures, we remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example, claims about someone's sexual activity.

In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to reporting such behaviour and content, we encourage people to use  tools available on Facebook  to help protect against it. \n    \n     We also have a  Bullying Prevention Hub , which is a resource for teenagers, parents and educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts.

Without necessity for coercion or force, it may still result in the exploitation of vulnerable individuals who are trying to leave their country of origin, often in pursuit of a better life.

Our policies are based on feedback from our community and the advice of experts in fields such as technology, public safety and human rights. To ensure that everyone's voice is valued, we take great care to craft policies that are inclusive of different views and beliefs, in particular those of people and communities that might otherwise be overlooked or marginalised. \n   \n         \n     REITERATING OUR COMMITMENT TO VOICE \n     The goal of our Community Standards has always been to  create a place for expression and give people a voice . This has not and will not change. Building community and bringing the world closer together depends on people's ability to share diverse views, experiences, ideas and information. We want people to be able to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable. In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Standards \u2013 if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We only do this after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards,  as reflected in our Corporate Human Rights Policy,  to make these judgments. As such, we consider the newsworthiness of content posted by anyone, including news organisations and individuals users. For example, we have allowed content that graphically depicts war or the consequences of war where it is important to public discourse.  \n    \n     Our commitment to expression is paramount, but we recognise that the Internet creates new and increased opportunities for abuse. For these reasons, when we limit expression, we do it in service of one or more of the following values: \n   \n       \n\n     Authenticity:  We want to make sure that the content people are seeing on Facebook is authentic. We believe that authenticity creates a better environment for sharing, and that's why we don't want people using Facebook to misrepresent who they are or what they're doing.\n \n    \n    \n      \n    \n     Safety:  We are committed to making Facebook a safe place. Expression that threatens people has the potential to intimidate, exclude or silence others and isn't allowed on Facebook. \n  \n    \n  \n    \n    \n     Privacy:  We are committed to protecting personal privacy and information. Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and to choose how and when to share on Facebook and to connect more easily.\n \n        \n  \n    \n     Dignity:  We believe that all people are equal in dignity and rights. We expect that people will respect the dignity of others and not harass or degrade others. \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n     Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. They're designed to be comprehensive \u2013 for example, content that might not be considered hateful may still be removed for violating a different policy. We recognise that words mean different things or affect people differently depending on their local community, language or background. We work hard to account for these nuances while also applying our policies consistently and fairly to people and their expression. Our enforcement of these standards relies on information available to us. In some cases, this means that we may not detect content and behaviour that violates these standards, and in others,  enforcement may be limited to circumstances where we have been provided with additional information and context. \n\n     People can report potentially violating content, including Pages, groups, profiles, individual content and comments. We also give people control over their own experience by allowing them to  block ,   unfollow  or   hide  people and posts.\n       \n\n     The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the violation and the person's history on the platform. For instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if they continue to violate our policies, we may restrict their ability to post on Facebook or disable their profile. We may also notify law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety. \n     Our Community Standards are a guide for what is and isn't allowed on Facebook. It is in this spirit that we ask members of the Facebook community to follow these guidelines. \n      Please note that the US English version of the Community Standards reflects the most up-to-date set of the policies and should be used as the master document. \n   \n "},"dummyElem":{"__m":"__elem_fc9f538f_0_0_l9"},"acrossTransitions":false,"clobberSiblings":false,"preloader":null,"bigPipeContext":{"__bigPipeContext":1},"nonBlockingPreloaders":null}]],["BDClientSignalCollectionTrigger","startSignalCollection",[],[{"sc":"{\"t\":1618437631,\"c\":[[30000,838801],[30001,838801],[30002,838801],[30003,838801],[30004,838801],[30005,838801],[30006,573585],[30007,838801],[30008,838801],[30009,838801],[30010,838801],[30012,838801],[30013,838801],[30015,806033],[30018,806033],[30019,806033],[30040,806033],[30093,806033],[30094,806033],[30095,806033],[30100,541591],[30101,541591],[30102,541591],[30103,541591],[30104,541591],[30106,806039],[30107,806039],[38000,541427],[38001,806643]]}","fds":60,"fda":60,"i":60,"sbs":1,"dbs":100,"bbs":100,"hbi":60,"rt":262144,"hbcbc":2,"hbvbc":0,"hbbi":30,"sid":-1,"hbv":"8281042082336315465"}]],["CavalryLoggerImpl","startInstrumentation",[],[]],["NoscriptOverride","redirectToJSPage",[],["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/"]],["NavigationMetrics","setPage",[],[{"page":"WebCommunityStandardsController","page_type":"normal","page_uri":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/","serverLID":"6987678402544563806-0"}]],["FalcoLoggerTransports","attach",[],[]],["DimensionTracking"],["ClickRefLogger"],["DetectBrokenProxyCache","run",[],[0,"c_user"]],["NavigationClickPointHandler"],["WebDevicePerfInfoLogging","doLog",[],[]],["WebStorageMonster","schedule",[],[]],["Artillery","disable",[],[]],["ScriptPathLogger","startLogging",[],[]],["TimeSpentBitArrayLogger","init",[],[]],["Animation"],["VideosRenderingInstrumentation","storeRenderTime",["__elem_a648e52c_0_0_H8"],[{"__m":"__elem_a648e52c_0_0_H8"}]],["__inst_a648e52c_0_0_x0"],["VideoDisplayTimePlayButton","register",["__elem_8937e029_0_0_kz","__elem_0bcc40a7_0_0_pu"],[{"__m":"__elem_8937e029_0_0_kz"},{"__m":"__elem_0bcc40a7_0_0_pu"}]],["__inst_3f1e98e4_0_0_rz"],["__inst_0bcc40a7_0_0_0w"],["__inst_ebb64f7c_0_0_sl"],["__inst_98d9a45e_0_0_1Y"],["__inst_21a8c1d4_0_0_rr"],["__inst_dbb8a0b1_0_0_lx"],["__inst_74f26af1_0_0_CO"],["__inst_70dbca80_0_0_VO"],["__inst_6d29ee41_0_0_Ot"],["VideoDashPrefetchCache","loadVideo",[],[{"videoID":1476674392421025,"manifest":[],"video":[{"url":"https:\/\/video-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/20391339_1438399146197396_6698387465348055040_n.mp4?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=5aebc0&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfMTI4MF9jcmZfMjNfaGlnaF8zLjFfZnJhZ18yX3ZpZGVvIn0\u00253D&_nc_ohc=NXojYD4XdScAX-nbDLq&_nc_ht=video-sjc3-1.xx&oh=b8eaaaeee41567560989336ca40b8e7f&oe=60F95532","start":0,"end":956,"segment_type":"init","mime_codec":"video\/mp4;
